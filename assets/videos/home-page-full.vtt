00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.140
- [Narrator] This is Wayne.

2
00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:05.550
As a sports fan, he understands
all about how numbers

3
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.730
and analytics can determine
the success of a team.

4
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.830
Pro sports use data to
minimize the risk of loss

5
00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.410
and maximize the likelihood of success.

6
00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:15.891
For years, he's been thinking about

7
00:00:15.891 --> 00:00:18.520
how to apply that concept at work.

8
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.220
As someone who assesses
risk for his company,

9
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.190
he's always looking to
limit their exposure.

10
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.430
But he wants more extensive coverage,

11
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.550
and knows that analytics
are the way to get it.

12
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.670
Barbara, on the other hand,
hasn't even thought of it.

13
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.440
She too, manages risk for her company.

14
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.210
Sure, they can test a
sample of transactions,

15
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.970
and they can use surveys and meetings

16
00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.770
to develop their risk assessments,

17
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.400
which can be inefficient and
relies on informal evidence.

18
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.760
What Barbara doesn't know is
just how much more effective

19
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.930
her job would be if she used analytics.

20
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.300
Green Skies Analytics work
with risk-minded people,

21
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.660
like Wayne and Barbara

22
00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.030
to automate processes,
analyze, and visualize data,

23
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.230
and provide wisdom from their data.

24
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.930
They can test 100% of the
data instead of a sample,

25
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.230
providing greater knowledge
of how to mitigate risk.

26
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.800
Whether it's for using analytics to drive

27
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.090
the risk assessment program,
testing specific controls

28
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.840
in your audit program,
dashboard development,

29
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.650
providing support of your
compliance regulations,

30
00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.420
addressing fraud risk management,

31
00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.750
or expanding your enterprise
risk management program.

32
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.430
Wayne and Barbara need to know that

33
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.210
the time is coming when
companies will be required

34
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.430
to use analytics for risk management,

35
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.670
and that now is the time
to get ahead of the curve.

36
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.730
Why now?

37
00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.310
That's because a few major
forces are changing the market.

38
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.640
First, the regulators are
using data analytics and will

39
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.060
have an expectation that
Wayne and Barbara do the same.

40
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.300
Second, the demand for
data analytics is high.

41
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.040
Google trends show it's increased

42
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.060
nearly 300% in the past five years.

43
00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.560
Yet data analyst jobs are
the most challenging to fill,

44
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.830
and third, the technology for audit

45
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.020
and risk specific data
analytics has matured.

46
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.380
So now the tools are available.

47
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.730
Because Barbara already had her audit plan

48
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:10.210
for the year in place,

49
00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.020
they work with her to use analytics

50
00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.650
to complement her
traditional controls testing.

51
00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.150
Wayne, on the other hand,

52
00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.550
was still putting his audit plan together.

53
00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.690
Green Skies used analytics to give him

54
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.590
a visual representation
of the high risk areas

55
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.130
to aide his decision in the audit plan

56
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.650
and because the reports provided
interactive visualization

57
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.960
of the data, both Wayne and Barbara

58
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.640
were able to present more
comprehensive information

59
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.160
to their audit committees,
compliance departments,

60
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.110
financial statement
auditors, and executives.

61
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.370
If you are like Wayne or
Barbara, and want to do more,

62
00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.600

insight, more wisdom,

63
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.229
let Green Skies Analytics be your partner.

64
00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:52.646
